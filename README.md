# Python-Patterns-
## Hi! Here I will upload a regular Python pattern program with an explanation.

### <li> Steps to Print a Pattern in Python
<ol>
<li>  Decide the Number of Rows:
        Before you begin, could you determine the size of the pattern, usually based on the number of rows?
You can accept the number of rows from the user using the input() function.
<li> Outer Loop for Rows:</br>
        The outer loop controls the number of rows in the pattern.
If there are n rows, the loop will run n times.
<li> Inner Loop for Columns:</br>
        The inner loop is responsible for each row's number of elements (stars, numbers, etc.).
The number of columns typically depends on the current row number, which the outer loop controls.
<li> Print the Pattern Symbol:</br>
        Inside the inner loop, use the print() function to display the symbol (like *, #, or a number).
Use print() with the end=" " parameter to keep printing on the same line.
Move to the Next Line After Each Row:

</ol>

After completing a row, use print() without any arguments to move the cursor to the next line.
This ensures the next set of symbols is printed on a new line.
